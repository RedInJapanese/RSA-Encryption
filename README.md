# RSA Encryption
These programs implement the RSA encryption algorithm using Carmichael's lambda function instead of Euler's totient function

# Building

Run the following to build the 'keygen', 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' executables

```
make
```

In order to build them separately, you can append either 'keygen', 'encrypt', or 'decrypt'.

Run the following to delete executables and objects
```
make clean
```

# Running Keygen
```
./keygen
```

# Running Encrypt
```
./encrypt
```

# Running Decrypt
```
./decrypt
```
